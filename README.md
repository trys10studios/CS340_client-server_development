# Final Project Reflection 

# 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

In developing the CRUD Python module from Project One, I really focused on making my code user-friendly and easy to work with. I made sure to use clear, descriptive names for variables and functions, which helped anyone looking at my code (including myself later) understand what each part was doing right away. I also incorporated comments and docstrings to explain the trickier sections, ensuring that anyone who picks up the code can quickly grasp its purpose. This approach not only made it easier for me to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two, but it also means I can easily reuse and adapt the module for future projects. One of the best parts of this design is its modularity; I can extend its functionality without a headache, speeding up my development process and minimizing the chances of bugs creeping in. 

# 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 

When tackling the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, my first step was to dive deep into the project specifications to really understand what the client needed. I broke down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks, which allowed me to create a clear roadmap for development. This structured approach felt different from previous assignments in other courses, where I might have rushed in without a solid plan. For this project, I prioritized maintaining open communication with stakeholders and using iterative development, which helped ensure that the final product truly met user expectations. Looking ahead, I’d continue to apply these techniques, like agile methodologies and incorporating user feedback, to create databases that are not just functional but truly responsive to client needs. 

# 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 

Computer scientists are problem solvers who design and implement solutions to complex challenges using computational methods. Their work is crucial across various industries, enabling organizations to process data effectively, automate tasks, and make informed decisions. In my work on the Grazioso Salvare project, I aimed to create a functional and user-friendly dashboard that streamlines data management. By developing a system that simplifies tracking and filtering rescue animal data, I’m helping the organization allocate resources more efficiently, ultimately improving their ability to serve the community. It’s rewarding to know that my work can have a direct impact on helping others.
